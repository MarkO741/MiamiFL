# About Miami, FL 
Miami is a beautiful place full of buildings and latin people all going about there lives. As an Anglo/Sacen I am not really part of there world even though I speak Spanish.
I speak Spanish almost as well as any of the latin people, so I think, however it is quite another thing to understand there language,
especialy when you learned to speak there language as an adult. Americans are grosly outnumbered here in Miami so when it comes time to
buy anything or just ask the time of day it is very aparent that there is a wall there, a wall because of language barier. Only a person 
that has been raised speaking a language can speak and understand it like a native. So I live here in Miami for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years and 
I have been living with this isolation from everybody. Yes I can talk fluintly in there language, but I don't understand what they are 
saying to me, so it ends there. They say something and I respond and then they say something else and I don't understand and they give up,
that's it! I can't really have a relationship with any of them because I don't understand what they are saying. Well, take it from me, 
an Anglo/Saxon American man that fell in love with the beautiful Spanish ladies and then got stuck here in Miami, either learn the second language well or don't live where you don't understand the language of the majority of the people who live there. Don't get me wrong, I
love my life but it is just a drag that I am an outsider in a world that is not of my youth.
